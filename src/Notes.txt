1. SASS
 - Used for styling.
 - Advanced CSS.
 - npm install node-sass 
 - & means class above it and it wants to append the additional selector

2. Git
 - New repository
 - copy SSH link e.g. https://github.com/Delvin2011/lavie-clothing.git
 - git remote add origin https://github.com/Delvin2011/lavie-clothing.git

3. DOM bindings for React Router DOm.
 - npm install --save react-router-dom
 - https://reacttraining.com/react-router/
 - BrowserRouter gives the App all the functionality that the react-router-dom provides.
 - <Switch> - As long as one route matched, thats what will be rendered.
 - exact renderes exactly what on the path. (if no exact, all the paths follows will also render on the homepage)
 - Switch and exact used to determine what component to mount, without re-rendering the whole application
 - match, history and location.
 - Even though Directory and Menu item are children of HomePage component, Only the homepage gets access to the history prop.

4. withRouter
 - Takes a component as a an argument and returns a modified component.
 - is a higher order component that will pass closest route's match , current location , and history props to the wrapped component whenever it renders.
 - its like a function that gives a powered up component.
 - e.g. pass MenuItem into withRouter.
 - withRouter will return us back a super powered component, with access to location, match, history prps that we need access to.
 - e.g. if we are to change our URL at any moment, our component is still aware and functional bcoz it knows its just gonna base where its been matched up to and open the URL

5. SVG
 - scalable vector image. very small.
 - Special syntax for importing SVG (ReactComponent as Logo)
 - he ReactComponent import name is special and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.

6. Firebase
 - Authentication and storage
 - npm install --save firebase
 - npm install firebase --force (used)
 - Cloud Firestore, is a no SQL database. Giahantic json object.
 - Collection - a group of objects - a document, an array of things. e.g. /users
 - Collections can also point to other collections
 - adding a user will be adding a document. every document/user needs a unique identifier.

7. Quiz
 - Whenever we call the onAuthStateChanged() or onSnapshot() methods from our auth  library or referenceObject, we get back a function that lets us unsubscribe from the listener we just instantiated. Which lifecycle method should we use to call that unsubscribe method in?
 - Answer: - Calling the unsubscribe function when the component is about to unmount is the best way to make sure we don't get any memory leaks in our application related to listeners still being open even if the component that cares about the listener is no longer on the page.

8. Plans -Future
 - Chat box
 - Receipt upon purchase
 - store order in database

9. mapStateToProps vs mapDispatchToProps
 - As the names would suggest, mapStateToProps connects the Redux state into your component via props (reference your root reducer to see all the various states that you have declared).
   You'll need to use it when a particular component requires some info from the global state.
 - Whereas mapDispatchToProps will connect your action creators to your component (actions you've created in your xxx.action.js files if you've followed the naming convention from the course).

10. Reselect
 - used to memoize and not re-render a component if the state value does not change, e.g dropdown and item count components not re-rendered when state changes are unrelated to them.
 - npm install reselect
 - Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
 - Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
 - Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.
